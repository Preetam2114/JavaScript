## 4 Pillars of OOP

### **Encapsulation:**

In object-oriented programming, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.

**Example:**

**Procedural implementation:**
```js
    let baseSalary = 30_000;
    let overtime = 10;
    let rate = 20;

    function getWage(baseSalary, overtime, rate){
        return baseSalary + (overtime*rate);
    }
```

**OOP implementation:**
```js
    let employee = {
        basesalary:30_000,
        overtime: 10,
        rate:20,
        getWage: function(){
            return this.basesalary +(this.overtime*this.rate);
        }
    };
    employee.getWage();
```

### **Abstraction:**

Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.

**Advantages of Abstraction:**
- It reduces the complexity of viewing the things.
- Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
- Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.

### **Inheritance**: 

Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.

You can use it to declare different kinds of exceptions, add custom logic to existing frameworks, and even map your domain model to a database.

**Example:**

### **Polymorphism:**

The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.
